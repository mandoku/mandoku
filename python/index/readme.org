#+TITLE: Index

* Generation of index files

  The files in this directory are for generating a ngram index for
  mandoku texts.  They have been developed and used in early 2010 for
  some collections, some of them are thus very specific.

* plans

  A new index using redis is under development, the files here are
  only made available as a stopgap measure until this new index gets
  available.

** update
   <2012-04-03 Tue> It seems to me now, that rather than using redis,
   couchdb would be a better choice.  The problems I see with redis are
   - size of database
     - at some point, and probably rather soon a db that requires
       everything to be in memory will be too small
   - replication: this is one important point were couchdb excells.
   - speed ? WIll need to check for that, but I hope that it will be
     in the same ballpark
   - at some later point, I hope to move the dictionary stuff also
     into couchdb.
